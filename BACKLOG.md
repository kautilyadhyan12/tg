# BACKLOG.md — the LOG of LOW-severity review findings

Created 2026-08-06 by Kd's ruling on the fixed review/fix process
(`DECISIONS.md:5348`, restated at `CLAUDE.md` Part I §2.5).

## What this file is — and what it is NOT

**It is a LOG.** A Low finding — spelling, comments, naming, style — is written
here with the round that found it and the commit that fixed it. Its purpose is
that a Low finding is **visibly accounted for without buying another review
round**. That is the whole of what rule 1 changed.

**LOW FINDINGS ARE STILL FIXED before the packet closes.** Kd ruled this
explicitly when correcting a draft that said otherwise: *"no, they will be
fixed."* Nothing is left undone because it was Low. This file records the fixing;
it does not excuse skipping it.

**IT IS NOT A SECOND DEFERRAL LIST.** `OWED.md` is unchanged and remains the
single authority for everything outstanding. If a Low finding genuinely cannot be
fixed in its round, it has stopped being a log entry and become a **deferral** —
so it takes an `OWED.md` line, in the same commit, like anything else.

**Nothing Critical/High ever appears here.** Security, data loss, privacy, money
and broken core flows are fixed, or they hold the packet. If you are unsure which
side a finding falls on, it is Critical/High.

## Format

```
- [x] <what was wrong, where> — found <date>, <card / round> — fixed <commit>
- [ ] <same, still open — and if it will not be fixed this round, it also needs
      an OWED.md line, so say which>
```

## Log

### Post-workout summary repoint (card 1 of the workout core loop), 2026-08-06

The first card run under the fixed review/fix process. Its own test audit
(rule 4) produced these; all three are Low, all three are FIXED, none bought a
review round.

- [x] **The mutation harness's final restore check asked GIT, which cannot answer
      it.** `git diff --name-only` compares the tree against HEAD, so on a branch
      with uncommitted work — i.e. every branch a sweep runs on — it reports the
      CARD'S OWN changes as harness damage. A clean 14/14 sweep ended
      `*** TARGETS STILL MODIFIED ***` and exit 1, naming four files whose
      mutated lines were each verified back to their originals. Failed toward a
      FALSE ALARM, which is the safe direction and the only reason this is Low
      rather than an incident — the shape is :5199's. Now compares each target
      against its pre-run byte snapshot; re-verified on a 2-mutant subset, exit 0.
      — found by the audit itself, fixed same commit
      (`tools/mutate-workout-summary.mjs`).
- [x] **The harness read a PASSING suite as RED.** `execFileSync` with the default
      1 MB `maxBuffer` threw ENOBUFS on the ~3-minute api DB suite, and a bare
      `catch { return "RED" }` turned that into a verdict. It surfaced on the
      baseline gate, where it merely aborted; one step later it would have scored
      every mutant "caught" while nothing was asserted. A runner error now ABORTS
      instead of resolving to a verdict. — fixed same commit.
- [x] **Two comments in `PostWorkout.jsx` asserted the opposite of the code**
      after the repoint (that the new API has no per-workout XP field, and why the
      XP bar starts empty). Rewritten rather than deleted, per :3610's lesson that
      a wrong comment can re-arm a fixed bug. — fixed same commit.
