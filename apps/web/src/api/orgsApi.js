// Gym console — the org slice on the NEW /v1 API, via the Card-1 cookie client
// (httpOnly session; no tokens in JS). Shapes are `@app/shared` orgs.ts:
// `createOrgRequestSchema` / `createOrgResponseSchema`, `myOrgsResponseSchema`,
// `orgMemberPageSchema`, `orgCodesResponseSchema`.
//
// NOTHING HERE RETRIES. `authApi`'s interceptor retries once on a 401 (the
// server rejected the request before running it), which is safe for the create
// POST; a network-failure retry is not, and R10.2 forbids one on a POST without
// an Idempotency-Key. Creating a gym has no key, so a dropped connection leaves
// the owner to press the button again — a visible duplicate beats a silent one.
